PURPOSE: This specific app was to learn how to design and create my first mobile app. 
The app lets the user choose from several different locations and see the time of that location. 
If the location is in the evening then it will show a night photo in the background along with the 
time in that location. If the location is in the morning then it will show a sunny photo in the background
along with the time in that location.
